ppooled-pg
==========

> Promisified PostgreSQL driver with more effective pooling strategies.


Brief
-----

This is simply a personal promise wrapper for wonderful but non promise aware
PostgreSQL driver [pooled-pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pooled-pg).

This is not intended, at least nowadays, to be a complete full-featured tool.
This only has methods I found handy for my own purposes.

But push requests are welcome if anyone is interested in improving it.

Setup
-----

```sh
    npm install ppooled-pg
```


Usage
-----


### Instantiation

```javascript

var pPooled = require("ppooled-pg");

var ppg = pPooled({
    protocol: "postgresql", // "postgresql" (default) or "remote".
                        // See https://www.npmjs.com/package/pooled-pg#advanced-usage-remote-mode
    user: "db_user_name",
    password: "db_user_password",
    connect: "db_user_connect_string",
        // See pooled-pg documenetation for more details on connect string:
        // https://www.npmjs.com/package/pooled-pg
});

```


### Promisified methods


#### query(sql, args)

Simple wrapper to pooled-pg query method.

```javascript
var q = ppg.query(sql, args);

q.then(function(result){
    console.log(result);
    // result.rows = Actual result data.
}.catch(function(err){
    console.error(err);
    // Some error happened.
});
```


#### queryRows(sql, args)

Like `query()` but strip out all metadata retuning just resulting rows (more
handy if you don't care about other stuff).

```javascript
var q = ppg.queryRows(sql, args);

q.then(function(result){
    console.log(result);
    // result = Actual result data.
}.catch(function(err){
    console.error(err);
    // Some error happened.
});
```

### Synchronous methods

Synchronous methods works just the same as its promisified counterparts (in
fact they are just wrappers over them) but returns data syncronously instead of
as promise.

>
It may seem weird having synchronous methods in a promise library. But
sometimes is Ok to read some data synchronously. Specially at startup, when is
so common having to read common parameters that are needed for almost all the
rest of the process.
>
Having synchronous methods saves us to be forced to install another PostgresSQL
library to do just that and, most importantly, dealing with different syntax
and / or outcome formatting.

### querySync(sql, args):

```javascript
try {
    console.log(ppg.querySync(sql, args));
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    // Some error happened.
};
```

### queryRowsSync(sql, args):

```javascript
try {
    console.log(ppg.queryRowsSync(sql, args));
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    // Some error happened.
};
```



Advanced Features
-----------------

Passing arguments as an array can be awkward sometimes. Specially if you have a
lot of them.

JSON objects are much more handy, but most SQL engines only accept arguments as
positional parameters.

*ppooled-pg* takes advantadge of ES6+ wonderful *Symbol* feature to allow
providing SQL as a String object with optional "arguments" symbol for that.

**Example:**
```
const $args$ = Symbol.for("arguments");

const sql = new String(`
    select foo from bar
    where baz = $1
    and foobar = $2
`);

sql[$args$] = ["baz", "foobar"];

ppg.queryRows(sql, {
  foobar: "foobar value",
  baz: "baz value"
}).then(data=>console.log(data));

```

>
Also, not provided values are silently replaced by nulls as well so, for
inserts and updates, there is no need to pass all parameters if they aren't
declared as 'NOT NULL' or have a default value.
